        <p>The British &amp; Irish Lions will go into Saturdayâ€™s first Test against New Zealand with spirits
            high after a convincing victory over the Chiefs in Hamilton. The England wing Jack Nowell scored
            a brace of well-taken tries and Jared Payne also scored against his former team as the Lions
            cruised to their first midweek win of the tour.</p>
